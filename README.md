This project utilizes NodeJS, AngularJS, & MongoDB to create an application with CRUD functionality similar to Goodreads. There are four CRUD components allowing for the addition of different content, mimicking a real, interactive webpage. A demo of this application can be seen [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVrHqzy1iM8)  

# MeanTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.1. To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
In addition to Angular, this project utiluzed NodeJS for the back-end CRUD component. I did not include node_modules in this upload, they can be installed by running npm install in terminal in the project folder. Finally, this project also made use of MongoDB to record our imputs there.
